### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at the Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia. I'm passionate about Linux and Open Source. In my free time I like to work on my [Personal Development Environment](https://www.github.com/samodostal/.dotfiles) (what is [PDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg&t=11s)?). Professionally, I am a Full Stack TypeScript developer with deep desire to practice and write clean and efficient code. Welcome to my GitHub, check out my projects down below.
