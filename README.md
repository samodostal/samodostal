### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at the Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia. I'm passionate about Linux and open source. In my free time I like to build [Weird Keyboards](https://github.com/samodostal/keyboards) and work on my [Personalized Development Environment](https://www.github.com/samodostal/.dotfiles) (what is [PDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg)?). Professionally, I am a Full Stack TypeScript developer with deep desire to practice and write clean and efficient code. Welcome to my GitHub :), check out my projects down below.
